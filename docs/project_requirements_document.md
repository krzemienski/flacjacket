**Project Requirements Document for 'flacjacket': Shazam-Like Audio Recognition and Track Extraction**

---

### 1. Project Overview

**flacjacket** is a web application designed to cater to music enthusiasts, DJs, and music curators by analyzing long audio files, like DJ mixes and live concert recordings, from platforms such as SoundCloud or YouTube. Its primary function is to accurately identify individual tracks within these lengthy audio recordings, using advanced audio fingerprinting technologies similar to those employed by Shazam, and then offering users the ability to download these tracks in high-quality formats.

The project aims to solve the challenge of manually identifying and segmenting individual tracks within long audio recordingsâ€”a task that typically lacks accuracy and can degrade the audio quality. By offering high-fidelity recognition and download capabilities, **flacjacket** ensures that users enjoy a seamless experience, free from the limitations of existing tools. Key success criteria for this project include accurate track identification, minimal audio quality loss, and an intuitive user interface.

### 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**
- URL input from SoundCloud or YouTube to download high-quality audio.
- Audio processing through fingerprinting to detect individual tracks and metadata retrieval.
- Display of recognized tracks with options for high-quality downloads.
- Development of an administrative panel for historical overview and error logging.
- Dockerized deployment to streamline setup and ensure reproducibility.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Integration with payment processors for monetization at this stage.
- Development of a dedicated mobile app.
- Real-time streaming or external database expansion beyond the initial setup.

### 3. User Flow

A typical user journey begins when a visitor enters a SoundCloud or YouTube URL into **flacjacket's** React-based interface. The user submits this URL through a simple input form, triggering the backend process managed by Flask. Here, tools like `scdl` for SoundCloud or `yt-dlp` for YouTube are used to download the highest quality audio available. The downloaded audio is then processed using chosen open-source audio recognition solutions, which detect and identify individual tracks.

Users are presented with a list of recognized tracks in the application's interface, each accompanied by relevant metadata like song title and artist. They have the option to download these tracks individually or as a batch in high-quality formats. An admin panel exists to manage and view a history of processed recordings and address any issues encountered during processing.

### 4. Core Features

### 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- Assumption of GPT-4o availability for advanced AI code scaffolding.
- All audio processing libraries employed are open-source and compliant with relevant usage laws.
- Deployment targets desktop web browsers, assuming adequate user resources for handling large files.

### 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Limits and Downtime:** Possible issues with large audio recognition databases like AcoustID.
- **Platform Terms of Service:** Awareness and adherence to SoundCloud and YouTube policies to avoid legal issues.
- **Audio Recognition Accuracy:** Variability based on the quality of the database and fingerprinting technology used.

By strictly adhering to this Project Requirements Document, development on **flacjacket** can proceed with clarity and precision, resulting in a solution that enhances user experience by making high-quality track identification and extraction accessible and reliable.
